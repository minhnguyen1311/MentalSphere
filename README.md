# Description
MentalSphere is an interactive 3D globe that brings mental health into focus. Built with Three.js, this project transforms real-world mental health statistics into an engaging, visually stimulating experience. Users can explore global data on depression rates through a colorful and intuitive interface, allowing them to see the varying mental health realities across countries and regions.

**Key Features:**
- **Interactive 3D Globe**: A dynamic, rotating globe that lets users zoom in and explore regions across the world.
- **Color-Coded Data Visualization**: Countries are color-coded based on depression rates—green for low, yellow for moderate, and red for high. This visual cue makes it easier to identify areas with varying mental health challenges.
- **Engaging User Experience**: In addition to displaying the depression rate, the globe allows users to interact with the data, offering an immersive way to learn about mental health statistics.
- **Real-World Data**: The project leverages actual mental health data from https://ourworldindata.org/, transforming it into an easy-to-understand, visually rich representation.

# Installation
To get MentalSphere up and running, all you need is a web browser and a simple code editor like Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Here’s how to get started:

1. Clone the MentalSphere repository from GitHub to your local machine:
   - git clone https://github.com/minhnguyen1311/MentalSphere.git

2. Open the project in VSCode:
   - After cloning the project, open the MentalSphere folder in VSCode.

3. Run the project:
   - Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. No complex setup needed!
   - If you want to see live changes, you can also use an extension in VSCode (like Live Server) to serve the project in your browser.
  
# Usage
Once you've successfully installed and set up MentalSphere, you can interact with the 3D globe and explore the data in an intuitive way.

**- Explore the Globe:**
  - Use your mouse or trackpad to rotate the globe by clicking down the left mouse and dragging to your desirable direction.
  - Zoom in and out to explore different countries and regions using the mouse trackball (roll up or down).
  - Hover over any country to see the depression rate visualized with color-coded markers.
    - Green: Depression rate ≤ 5%
    - Yellow: 5% < Rate < 7%
    - Red: Rate ≥ 7%
   
# Future Improvements
MentalSphere is a foundation for exploring various global statistics in an interactive and engaging way. In the future, this project could be expanded and adapted to visualize a wide range of data sets. Here are some ideas for future improvements:
1. Support for Additional Data Sets:
   - The globe could be easily modified to represent different global statistics, such as:
       - Cancer statistics
       - COVID-19 data
       - Population demographics
       - Accidents caused by alcohol consumption
   - By simply replacing the depression rate dataset with other public datasets, users can explore a variety of global challenges and phenomena.
  
2. Customization
   - Users could customize the color-coding logic and visualization to represent different thresholds or categories of data based on their needs (e.g., color scales, legend adjustments).
   - Integrate a UI that allows users to select and load different datasets dynamically, providing a more interactive and user-friendly experience.
  
# Authors and Acknowledgment
This project was developed by Andrew (Minh) Nguyen (myself) as a personal project within the CS460 - Computer Graphics course at the University of Massachusetts Boston.

While the project is solely my own work, I would like to acknowledge the valuable lessons and support I received through this course, which significantly contributed to the success of this project. The knowledge gained from topics such as 3D graphics, Three.js, and data visualization has been instrumental in creating MentalSphere.

Special thanks to Professor Daniel Haehn for the guidance and support throughout the course, and to the CS460 staff for their assistance and resources. The course has been a key part of my journey as a developer, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to apply everything I learned to this project.

I would also like to thank the broader web development and open-source community for the resources and tutorials that have helped me along the way, especially the Three.js community, whose documentation and forums provided valuable insights.
